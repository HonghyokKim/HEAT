# An R package, HEAT (Heatwave effect Estimation via Adjustment for Temperature)

This package is the novel method to estimate the effect of heatwaves on a health outcome, proposed by Dr. Honghyok Kim (University of Illinois at Chicago). The following paper is available on arXiv.org and has been submitted to a scientific journal for publication.

Each function embeded in this package has a description file. Use "?functionname" in R for detail.


This package was validated for the replication of the results in the paper: daily time-series dataset for Seoul, South Korea (2006-2013). An R code and data set for replication is provided here.


This package is under additional validation for heatwave definitions that were not analyzed for the paper and adjustment for temperature with a longer lag period than the one used in the data analysis of the paper. Potential investigators are welcome to follow the methodology of the paper. If they are interested in other definitions and adjustment for temperature with a longer lag period, please reach out to Dr. Kim (honghyok@uic.edu) and make sure variables generated appropriate.
