# An R package, HEAT (Heatwave effect Estimation via Adjustment for Temperature)

This R package allows researchers to use the novel method to estimate the effect of heatwaves on a health outcome, proposed by Dr. Honghyok Kim (University of Illinois at Chicago) in the following paper. Each function embeded in this package has a description file. Use "?functionname" in an R environment for detail.

The pre-print is available on arXiv.org. The paper has been submitted to a scientific journal for peer-reviewed publication:

**Validation**

-This package has been validated for replicating the results presented in the paper. An R code and data set for replication is provided here: daily time-series dataset for Seoul, South Korea (2006-2013). Potential investigators can learn this package with them and are welcome to follow the methods presented in the paper.

-This package includes heatwave definitions that were not analyzed in the original paper and and a longer lag period for temperature adjustment than the one used in the paper. These are currently undergoing additional validation. In case potential investigators want to use other heatwave definitions and lag periods for the adjustment, please reach out to Dr. Kim (honghyok@uic.edu) and make sure variables generated appropriate for their purposes.
