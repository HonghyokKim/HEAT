# An R package, HEAT (Heatwave effect Estimation via Adjustment for Temperature)

Update: Oct 6, 2025

R code for the simulation analysis has been posted. 

Update: Aug 25, 2023

We have corrected an error that arose when the function "createADJforHT" was used to create non-piecewise temperature variables (piecewise=FALSE).

Update: Aug 30, 2023

Validation was conducted for other definitions of heatwaves.


This R package allows researchers to use the novel method to estimate the effect of heatwaves on a health outcome, proposed by Dr. Honghyok Kim (University of Illinois at Chicago) in the following paper. Each function embeded in this package has a description file. Use "?functionname" in an R environment for detail.

**Validation**

-This package has been validated for replicating the results presented in the paper.  R code and the data set for replication is provided here: daily time-series dataset for Seoul, South Korea (2006-2013). R code for the simulation analysis is also provided. I hope they are helpful for you to learn this package.

-This package includes heatwave definitions that were not analyzed in the original paper. In case potential investigators want to use other heatwave definitions, we highly encourage you to understand how this method works first. Please make sure if variables generated are appropriate for their purposes. If you have any questions, please email me at honghyok@uic.edu.
